# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The objective of this project is use Machine learning techniques such as Resampling, SMOTEENN and Emsemble classifiers to analyzed LoanStats data and predict the best possible credit risk outcome.

## Results:

## Random Oversampling

* Balanced Accuracy Score: 63.39%
* Precision Score - High Risk: 0.01
* Precision Score - Low Risk: 1.00
* Recall Score high risk: 69%
* Recall Score low risk: 61%


## SMOTE Oversampling

* Balanced Accuracy Score: 63.07%
* Precision Score - High Risk: 0.01
* Precision Score - Low Risk: 1.00
* Recall Score high risk: 60%
* Recall Score low risk: 66%
